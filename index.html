    <h1>Camping in the Woods</h1>
    <p>Ever since I was a child I have always loved camping. 
       From the fresh air in morning,to the sunlight in the afternoon,
       and the camp fire that glows at night, camping is an activity
       that captures all our senses unlike no other. My favorite camping spot
       is the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/eldorado/recarea/?recid=71013" target="_blank">Ice House Reservoir.</a>
       It's a small but beautiful spot with amazing
       scenery during the day and at night. I love the exclusivity of being in the 
       woods. All that is present is the sound of the breeze, birds, streams, and
       people bonding over a camp fire. I try to go camping every summer
       but in the case that I can't find the time, I will camp in my backyard,
       invite friends over, and make my own camp fire to try to create the
       <strong>atmosphere.</strong>   </p>
